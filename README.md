# Easylist-without-Networkfilters

I removed the Network Filters from Easylist for people who dont need it due to their hostfilex pihole or some other service already blocking network requests. THis should speed up adblocking because it has a lot less rules. 

These changes where made on the 20th of december 2021 and if Easylist changes, then those changed wont be updated.
